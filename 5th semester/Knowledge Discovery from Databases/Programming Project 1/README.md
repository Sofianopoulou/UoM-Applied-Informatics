In Programming Project 1 you will find the implementation of 
  1. the editing algorithm ENN-rule and 
  2. the instance reduction algorithm IB2. 
  
Both of the pseudo-codes can be found at ENN-rule.png and IB2.png respectively. 

The program works great for the datasets "iris.csv" and "letter-recognition.csv" which are provided.
In the file "edited datasets" you can find the results of the program after running ENN for k=3.
In the file "reduced datasets" you can find the results of the program after running ΙΒ2.
