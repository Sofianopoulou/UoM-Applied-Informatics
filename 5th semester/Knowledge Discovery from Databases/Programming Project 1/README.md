In Programming Project 1 you will find the implementation of: 
  1. the editing algorithm ENN-rule and 
  2. the instance reduction algorithm IB2. 
  
Both of the pseudo-codes can be found at ENN-rule.png and IB2.png respectively. 

The program works great for the datasets "iris.csv" and "letter-recognition.csv" which are provided, although for letter-recognition it takes aproximitely two minutes of running to give the final result.

In the file "edited datasets" you can find the results of the program after running ENN for k=3 for both "iris.csv" and "letter-recognition.csv".
In the file "reduced datasets" you can find the results of the program after running ΙΒ2 for both "iris.csv" and "letter-recognition.csv".

Future changes: Due to the deadline of the assignment, and because it works just like this, I didn't add any methods to the main. So that's something that I will change in the future if I ever play around with the code again.
